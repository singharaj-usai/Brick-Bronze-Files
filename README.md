# Overview

‚ö° Open sourcing a few updated Pokemon Brick Bronze codes from my Project Bronze files.

## Summary

üíª Pokemon Brick Bronze was a Roblox game from 2014 that was taken down due to copyright issues with Nintendo. This repository is a few essential codes that you can use on your reupload to have 3rd party data saving, which means every time the game gets taken down your data will transfer to the next reupload of the game because we are using Google's Firebase to store player's data.
